# Computational Theory Project Overview

# Akeem Jokosenumi - G00366442

This project includes many Python-based computational tasks:

- **Task 1: Binary Representations**  
  Implements 32-bit unsigned integers to carry out bit-level operations (rotations, choice, and majority functions)

- **Task 2: Hash Functions**  
  Implements a basic hash function using an altered version of the algorithm developed by Kernighan and Ritchie

- **Task 3: SHA-256 Padding**  
  Calculate how much padding a file needs to have in order to comply with SHA-256 standards

- **Task 4: Prime Numbers**  
  Generates the first 100 prime numbers using two methods: trial division and the Sieve of Eratosthenes

- **Task 5: Roots**  
  Computes the 32-bit fractional part of the square roots for the first 100 prime numbers

- **Task 6: Proof of Work**  
  Searches for English words with SHA-256 digests starting with the most leading zero bits

- **Task 7: Turing Machines**  
  Simulates a Turing Machine that increments a binary number on the tape

- **Task 8: Computational Complexity**  
  Implements Bubble Sort that counts comparisons and runs it on every permutation of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: numpy, scipy, os, requests, hashlib, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, statsmodels, sklearn, math, itertools

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook `tasks.ipynb` to execute and test all tasks.  
For individual script testing, run the respective functions as outlined in the code cells.
